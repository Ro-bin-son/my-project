I am really happy at Man City, especially with the people, the manager, the directors, the board, a group of amazing people...
You can write this, but I'm happy...
So I think I should focus on that...
You can think in two ways: last year I got 36 and this year I have 18,You can think whether it is good or not for me,
I think it's been a good season.
I have missed a lot of chances. I will keep on missing chances and I will still score goals.
It's something I have been working naturally on. Everything in life, if you overthink it, it's not good.
My life is about football so that's what I focus on. I have one career, my focus on scoring more goals and trying to score.

I don't play for individual awards. Maybe people would like me to be more marketable, but I understand football differently. I know
how it works so I don't get frustrated. If one day someone wants to reward the work, that's welcome, but it doesn't bother me at all.

Looks like most gents are saying some cool shit. There is no set time for how long. But generally men take shots with multiple
ladies, even on the same day. The ones who respond or reciprocate the attention will experience a quicker timeline in terms of
how fast the relationship progresses from meeting, to dates, to a relationship. Like they always say for men it's a numbers game,
for women it's a quality game.

It depends on her energy, I mean her attitude towards me when I come after her.....she might be doing shakara, but if she somehow
manages to be warm with me while doing her shakara, that is a green light right there, it will fuel me up for more chase, but if
she is just giving me attitude here and there, I will just back off without hesitation.....all in all, two weeks should be
healthy enough to make whatever decision she wants, after that na dulling, I will move to the next serious lady I like.

Put this into perspective.
Well, it's not only a question of how, but when will the documents be submitted.
The number is high in relative terms

Just to bring a comparative perspective, the idea is to create continuity

It it's taking off why were the spoilers deployed? And the flaps look like landing configuration. But if it was landing I'm not sure
an intentional tail strike was one of the test items
Was this a go around that didn't go well? Ideally the only part of any aircraft touching the ground at anytime during its active life
would be undercarriage. But sometimes.....
If during take-off the plane suffers a "tailstrike", where the plane uses an excessive angle-of-attack (AOA), the rear end of the fuselage
touches the ground.
If during a landing and the aircraft is not balanced over the runway threshold or in an excessive beam wind, it may be useful
 to land with one of the main undercarriage wheels touching the ground first so that the plane will gain ground purchase to minimise
 runway deviation. In an even nastier wind condition where the plane's vertical axis may also be involved, a nose wheel landing
 may occur. As a matter of choice do try to prevent this happening as the aircraft's design features do not include a safe form
  of nose landing.
Well for me if the tail strike have been noticed by the flight crew, they should continue take off procedures and inform the control tower
about the tail strike and a clearance to turn around to bring back the aircraft to the ground. However, if it was unnoticed, they
 should be flying continuously to their destination. Probably the next pilot will notice that during pre flight inspection.
Landing speeds play a large part of this type of event. Vref  puts the aircraft in the proper AOA on landing particularly in large
aircraft. Delaying touchdown and letting the speed decay below Vref in flare to get a "squeaker" raises the chance of a strike. I am
of the opinion that Vrefs plus ten is a good approach speed no wind to fly an approach. Close the throttles in the flare and let the plane
touch down naturally. On takeoff the desired rotation speed is 3 degrees per second up to TO pitch. At times it's advantageous to
 let the plane liftoff prior to pithing for V2+10. Tail strikes are avoidable but you must fly the airplane.
This aircraft in picture shown is very confusing, if this aircraft was landing, the picture does not show Full Flap deployment
usually indicated it's configured for landing - but does show wing spoilers deployed - what is suspect is, that this aircraft
is a company test bed aircraft going through flight dynamics testing to investigate the many wing configuration's what if's. The aircraft
has no branding or customer logos indicating customer ownership.
This was a manhandled takeoff cross configured to see what effects this aircraft could be exposed to. There is much data on the Boeing
website showing these crazy tests being performed on the 747 during its design / test certification period.

 No country has been, or will be threatening Russia. As for nuclear weapons, they have no purpose or function in this war. Only suicide.
 A tactical bomb in Ukraine will cause complete deletion of every military Russian Unit in Ukraine by conventional army. Russian soil
 is like it has been untouched. These hitting on Russian soil is strictly limited to locations used to fire against Ukraine. Would
 you like to live in the nuclear waste? There need to be many such bombs, which is completely unlikely. Both because of the disproportion
 that nobody will accept. And the consequences that follow from such weapon. This card is suicide only.

 "We are a collective - we win and lose together"
 "It hurts and we've got to feel the pain. It's a set-back. Hopefully that give us the motivation to go on and do something special at
     Wembley. We go again."
 "It's part of our job- we are professionals, and we have to do it. We owe it to the fans and the lads as a group of players because
  we've worked too hard to throw it away now."
 "We've got a massive run-in for the Premier League, a really big game against Chelsea and we have to take this as a motivation

 "The best thing in football is you have a game to put it right and Saturday is a massive game. It's a great opportunity to
  take this hurt and fire from our belly."
 "The hardest part of football is putting the ball in the back of the net."
 "You have to say they defended well. It's a tough one - as a whole we were probably the better team, but you have to take your hats off
  to Real Madrid.  Their game plan worked."
 "You do these drills eight times out of ten in training and it's very hard for the attackers to go and score when you're against
  a low block."
 "We should be used to that-we've dealt with that, especially for the last seven years since I've been here....people come to the
  Etihad, and they find it difficult."
 "We should have the experience to go and hurt the teams that come and do that."
 "The rub of the green wasn't on our side and especially when you go to penalties- I've been there for England and for City and
   lost and won. It's a flip of the coin."
 "It's very difficult. It's probably the cruellest way to ever lose a game but it's part and parcel of the game."
 "We're obviously extremely disappointed as a set of players and a club to not go and maintain the Champions League."
 "It wasn't to be, and we have to say a big congratulations to Real Madrid and wish them all the best in the competition."

Exit Limit: This is the maximum number of passengers an aircraft is certified to safel evacuate within 90 seconds, using only
 half the available exits. This certification ensures a swift evacuation in case of an emergency.
A380 Example: The Airbus A380 is cerfified for 853 passengers, but airlines typically don't install that many seats(highest so far is 615)
This is because airlines often prioritize comfort and amenities, leading to lower seat densities on larger aircraft.
Exit Limit vs.Actual Seating: The exit limit doesn't necessarily dictate the actual number of seats installed. Airlines have some
flexibility within reason, but they can't exceed the certified limit.
Boeing 777 Example: The Boeing 777-9 has a lower exit limit (475) compared to the slighly larger 777-300ER (550). This difference
is likely because Boeing anticipates airlines using the 777-9 for long- haul flights, which typically have lower passenger density
due to the need for more legroom and amenities on longer journeys. By installing fewer exits, Boeing can reduce weight and
maintenance costs.
